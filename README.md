This repository contains some projects I did in this course (Software Systems).

The most notable project is the Blackjack game which simulates a normal blackjack game.
Involved uses of multiple classes and an interface to handle random card dealing, concealing cards using boolean (face up or face down), and keeping track of which cards were dealt and how many are left in the pile using ArrayLists.
